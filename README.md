# generator-react-auth [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hutchgrant/generator-react-auth.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hutchgrant/generator-react-auth)

> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator

## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

![](http://i.imgur.com/JHaAlBJ.png)

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. _Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things._

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-react-auth from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-react-auth
```

Finally, initiate the generator(you can choose to configure environment):

```bash
$ mkdir awesome-app
$ cd awesome-app
$ yo react-auth
